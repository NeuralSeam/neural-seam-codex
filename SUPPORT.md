# Support

## Before opening anything

Most problems with this bundle are one of five things. [The troubleshooting table in the
README](./README.md#troubleshooting) covers them, and this order resolves them fastest:

1. `codex plugin list` shows `neural-seam@neural-seam`, and it is enabled.
2. `neural-seam version` answers, so the binary is on your `PATH`.
3. `codex mcp list` shows `neural-seam-runtime`.
4. The first tool call was not cancelled by an approval prompt. See
   [Approving the tools](./README.md#approving-the-tools).
5. `$neural-seam:ns-doctor`.

## Where to go

| What you have | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| A bug in this bundle: wrong skill, broken instruction, wrong or outdated documentation | [Open an issue](https://github.com/NeuralSeam/neural-seam-codex/issues) on this repository |
| An idea for this bundle | [Open an issue](https://github.com/NeuralSeam/neural-seam-codex/issues) using the feature request template |
| A security vulnerability | [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). **Not** a public issue |
| A question about your account, plan, projects or data | The support form at <https://app.neuralseam.cloud> |
| A problem in the `neural-seam` runtime, the backend or the web app | The support form at <https://app.neuralseam.cloud> |
| A problem in the Codex CLI itself | OpenAI's own channels |

Issues on this repository are read by the maintainers of the bundle. They are not an account support
channel, and they are public: do not paste tokens, project identifiers you consider private, or source
code you cannot share.

## What to include in an issue

The versions are what we ask for first, every time, so it saves a round trip to include them:

```
codex --version
neural-seam version
```

plus this bundle's version (`codex plugin list`, or the latest entry in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md))
and your operating system.

Then: what you ran, what happened, and what you expected. If a skill misbehaved, name it and quote the
exact text you typed, including the `$neural-seam:` namespace.

## Response expectations

This is a young project. Issues are triaged on a best effort basis, and there is no support SLA on this
repository. Security reports are the exception and have stated targets in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
