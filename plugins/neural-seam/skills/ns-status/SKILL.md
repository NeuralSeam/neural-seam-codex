description: "Neural Seam: read-only compass. Reports where the project stands (signed in, project created, project bound to this directory) and which command comes next. Activate when the developer asks where Neural Seam stands, whether the project is connected, why the neural-seam-runtime tools do not answer, or asks for $neural-seam:ns-status."

# $neural-seam:ns-status

Skill managed by Neural Seam. It **reports and stops**: no binding, no writing, no working around a
refusal. It is the compass.

## Act now

1. Call the `check_setup` tool of the `neural-seam-runtime` MCP server, with no arguments.
2. Report **from the response**, not from a table in this file:
   - present the `message` the runtime returned, and any URL it carries, **exactly as returned**.
     Never build a URL and never assume a port.
   - when the response points at a step the developer takes (signing in, creating or picking a project
     in the browser, running a command in the terminal), name that step and stop.
   - when the step matches one of the commands in `$neural-seam:ns-help`, name that command too.
3. If the runtime refused to bind because this directory is not a clone of the project's repository,
   show the refusal **as it came** and point at `$neural-seam:ns-clone`. A refusal is a result, not an
   error to route around.
4. If the call returns an `error` (network or sign in), say so and point at `$neural-seam:ns-doctor`
   instead of carrying on.

To be walked through the next step instead of only being told it, use `$neural-seam:ns-start`.

## What this skill does not do

- It keeps **no table of states and transitions**. The runtime owns the product's flow and returns a
  message written for the developer; this skill presents it. A state this file has never seen is
  handled like any other.
- It changes nothing: no binding, no card moved, no card closed.
- It builds no URLs and assumes no port.
