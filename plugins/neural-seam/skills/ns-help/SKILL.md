# $neural-seam:ns-help

Skill managed by Neural Seam. The map of the skills and the usual path through them. **It calls no
tool** - it is a static index. Present the content below, adapting the tone if the developer asked
about a specific case.

## How it works

There is one guided skill (`ns-start`), one that only reports (`ns-status`), and individual skills for
when you already know what you want. Running any of them again does only what is left.

- **I do not know what I need** - `$neural-seam:ns-start` walks you through the next step.
- **I just want to know where I am** - `$neural-seam:ns-status`.

Write every skill out **with the plugin namespace**, exactly as the tables below spell it. This host
invokes a plugin's skills as `$<plugin>:<skill>`, so `$neural-seam:` is part of the name, not
decoration.

## Getting set up

| Skill | What it does |
| ----- | ------------ |
| `$neural-seam:ns-status` | Reports the state and the command that comes next. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-start` | Guided: reads the state and advances one step. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-create` | No project yet: shows the setup wizard link. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-connect [<id>]` | Project already exists: binds it to this directory. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-clone <id>` | Clones the project's code only. Idempotent. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-doctor` | Repairs the environment: sign in, language servers, MCP registration. |

## Day to day

| Skill | What it does |
| ----- | ------------ |
| `$neural-seam:ns-generate` | Bootstraps the backlog: generates the artefacts and creates the cards. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-list [status] [kind]` | Lists the cards, grouped by status. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-open` | Shows the local dashboard link. |
| `$neural-seam:ns-exec <id>` | Renders a card's prompt for you to review and implement. |

## The usual path

1. `$neural-seam:ns-start` - sign in, set up and bind, until the state is ready.
2. `$neural-seam:ns-generate` - generate the artefacts and create the first cards.
3. `$neural-seam:ns-list` - pick a card.
4. `$neural-seam:ns-exec <id>` - implement it. Repeat 3 and 4.

Two things live outside the bundle: the `neural-seam` binary on your `PATH`, and `neural-seam login`.
If anything gets stuck, `$neural-seam:ns-doctor`.
